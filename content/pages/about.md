I'm Brian James, an aspiring bioinformaticist with a very wide breadth of other knowledge and interests. I graduated with Honors from the [University of Illinois][_UIUC] in Computer Science. Several years ago, I became a homeowner of a uniquely appropriate fixer-upper which has kept me busy with renovations and improvements.

My wife [Noelle James][_Noelle] is a behavioral geneticist. She is currently finishing her PhD in Neuroscience here at the U of I, after graduating from [Washington University in St. Louis][_WUSTL], where we met. 

My dog Kaylee is an adorable border collie / poodle hybrid. Even she's an intellectual. She uses a doorbell to go outside, has a vocabulary exceeding 150 words, and differentiates between conceptual categories like "something to chew" or "a tug toy".
