On Wednesday, [Noelle][nohelix] and I hosted an evening with her coworkers from the [Bell Lab][bell]. Things went very smoothly despite a delayed start. I'm not always the most social, so getting the chance to meet everyone over [RoboRally][bgg-robo] and pizza is certainly an opportunity to seize.

I'm already looking forward to next month's, which Emma has graciously volunteered to host. I may hear from Miles sooner, though, if he's really serious about painting miniatures. I certainly wouldn't mind a painting buddy, since that part of the hobby can be a little lonely.
