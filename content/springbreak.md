A sudden [roadtrip][] to Florida to rescue a friend placed me in a car for the vast majority of some thirty-one hours. The trip contributed 32 counties to my [travels in the United States][mobrule], increasing my total to 385. 

I must recommend against driving AL-87, particularly at night and in fog. Alabama is a surprisingly tall state and we were all quite ready to be done with it, particularly with that road as the finale of the outward leg. Thankfully the drive, as a whole, was straightforward and uneventful.
